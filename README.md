# vtol_bhaptics - A bhaptics integration mod into VTOL VR
## Features

* Thrust of your vehicle
* Ground acceleration and landing
* Collisions with other objects or missiles
* Hearth beat for Over-G dependend on G-Force magnitude
* Carrier Hook
* Ejection seat

## How To Install

* Download the [VTOL Modloader](https://vtolvr-mods.com/) run it and download the necessary files.
* Download the [release](https://github.com/McFredward/vtol_bhaptics/releases/tag/nativeModLoaderRelease) and extract the ``vtol_bhaptics`` folder into the ``\VTOL VR\VTOLVR_ModLoader\mods`` folder.
* Activate the mod through the Mod-Menu ingame.

## Known Issues
* DLC is currently not supported. Collisions are working but thrust works different for the helicopter. I will add this in the near future. All tested on game version 1.4.0 and X40 Tactsuit.
