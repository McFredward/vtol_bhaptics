# vtol_bhaptics - A bhaptics integration mod into VTOL VR
## Features

* Thrust of your vehicle
* Ground acceleration and landing
* Collisions with other objects or missiles
* Hearth beat for Over-G dependend on how much G-Force
* Carrier Hook
* Ejection seat

## How To Install

* Download the [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/) and install in on VTOLVR.exe.
* Run the game once so that MelonLoader can generate all necessary things.
* Download the [release](https://github.com/McFredward/vtol_bhaptics/releases/tag/release) and extract the files into your VTOL VR folder.

## Known Issues
* DLC is currently not supported. Collisions are working but thrust works different for the helicopter. I will add this in the near future. All tested on game version 1.4.0 and X40 Tactsuit.
